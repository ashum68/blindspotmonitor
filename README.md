# Blind Spot Monitor

Using OpenCV, the program will display a warning if a car is present in the detection zone. The YOLO Object Detection Algorithm is used to validate a vehicle in the detection zone and classify 
the type of vehicle (car, bike, truck, etc.).

You can try this program on a video or using a webcam by switching the VideoCapture method.

Below is a short demonstration:
